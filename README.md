# 🌱 GreenPulse AI

## Real-Time Urban Environmental Risk Intelligence Platform

Built for Hack For Green Bharat

---

## 🚀 Overview

GreenPulse AI is a real-time environmental intelligence system that continuously monitors environmental parameters, computes a composite risk score, detects anomalies, and generates governance-ready mitigation strategies.

Unlike traditional batch-based pollution dashboards, GreenPulse AI enables proactive environmental risk management.
